        The random solver is strictly used for benchmarking, demonstrating, etc.

        The random solver is technically exhaustive because there is no real
        endpoint. It continually chooses a random path and compares it to the
        current best path. Theoretically, if it ran forever, it would encounter
        every possible path and thus have the best solution.
