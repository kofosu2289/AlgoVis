        The shortest path solver is probably the most naive of the heuristic
        solvers. It is referred to as a greedy algorithm in the sense that it
        chooses the best possible option from the current state. In this case,
        the best option is the closest point to the current endpoint.

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body1">
        It is a heuristic because it does not yield the best possible route, but
        in many cases it does give a good approximation. There are plenty of
        approximations (including the default for this site), where the shortest
        path is more expensive than the optimal route. It is, however,
        incredibly fast relative to the exhaustive algorithms.
