          The traveling salesperson problem asks the question, "Given a list of
          cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the
          shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the
          origin city?". It has been studied extensively in computer science and
          plenty of algorithms have been presented. The goal of this application
          is to implement as many of the algorithms as possible, with the goal
          of making it easy to visualize the execution of the algorithm in
          real-time. Traveling Salesman algorithms typically fall into 2
          different categories, exhaustive and heuristic.

        <Typography variant="h6">Exhaustive</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">
          Exhaustive algorithms are guaranteed to find the best possible solution
          by evaluating every possible solution. These algorithms are typically
          significantly more expensive then the heuristic algorithms discussed
          next. The exhaustive algorithms implemented so far include: - depth
          first search: this algorithm brute forces every possible route and
          keeps track of which one had the cheapest cost (distance).
